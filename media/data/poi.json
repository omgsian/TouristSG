Hajjah Fatimah Mosque takes its name from its wealthy donor, a businesswoman who donated the land the mosque is built on in the 19th century.\n\nIt used to be the site of her own house but after several robberies and a fire, she decided to move and built a mosque there instead.\nFusion of East and West\n\nDesigned by an unknown Englishman, the mosqueï¿½s architecture is an intriguing mix of European, Malay and Chinese influences.\n\nErected in 1846, it has an onion-shaped dome, an ablution area that looks like a Malay house with traditional Malay-Muslim woodcarvings inside.\n\nYouï¿½ll notice Chinese glazed porcelain tiles in the parapet grilles on the windows and woodwork, on the minaret tower and the top walls of the roof parapet.\n\nBut what gets the most attention is the minaret, which decidedly resembles a church spire. It is three-tiered, with two octagonal towers and an elongated pyramid, and has often been compared to that of the first St Andrew's Church (which was replaced by the present-day edifice of St Andrewï¿½s Cathedral).",

Spouting water from its mouth, the Merlion statue stands tall at 8.6 metres and weighs 70 tonnes.\n\nThis icon is a ï¿½must-seeï¿½ for tourists visiting Singapore, similar to other significant landmarks around the world.\n\nBuilt by local craftsman Lim Nang Seng, it was unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the mouth of the Singapore River, to welcome all visitors to Singapore.",

The natural attractions of Chek Jawa were discovered, ironically, only when the area where it sits was slated for redevelopment in 2000.\n\nWhen Singaporeans realised what had been uncovered - a 100-hectare wetlands teeming with wildlife - they flocked to the area and plans for redevelopment were halted.\n\nIt was an accidental discovery that has since benefitted thousands of visitors to this treasure trove of biodiversity, where six major habitats meet and mix.\n\nTucked away in a corner of Pulau Ubin ï¿½ an island off mainland Singapore ï¿½ you will need to catch a ferry to get here. Once on the island, you can hire a van or rent a bicycle from the main village. The more adventurous can hike to the wetlands in about 40 minutes.\n\nThe 1.1-kilometre boardwalk along the coast is a convenient way to view the rich plant and marine life, while a 21-metre tall viewing tower also gives you a chance to observe birds like the Collared Kingfisher and Straw-headed Bulbul.\n\nGuided tours are available, while educational information about Chek Jawa can be found at the Visitor Centre and viewing jetty.",

Statues of these proud creatures have traditionally stood in front of imperial palaces, tombs and temples in ancient China for their mythical ability to protect.\n\nIndeed the 13.5-hectare garden feels like a slice of ancient China transplanted to the west of Singapore, complete with a series of stone bridges, pagodas and a tea house.\n\nDesigned by Taiwanese architect Prof. Yuen-chen Yu and built in 1975, the space is modelled after the northern Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscaping, particularly during the Sung dynasty period. The ï¿½Bai Hong Qiaoï¿½ bridge, for instance, follows the style of the 17-Arch Bridge at the Summer Palace in Beijing. Other highlights include a Bonsai Garden, which houses a collection of over a hundred beautifully-manicured bonsais imported from Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand.\n\nMeanwhile, kids will delight at the Live Turtle And Tortoise Museum, which is home to more than 200 turtles and tortoises in over 60 different species.\n\nThe usually tranquil grounds burst into life during traditional Chinese festivals like Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\nA stroll through the meandering footpaths is a nice change of pace from the bustling city. And if you canï¿½t get enough of the serenity of the Chinese Garden, simply cross over to the nearby Japanese Garden, a model of Japanese gardens from the middle ages.",
